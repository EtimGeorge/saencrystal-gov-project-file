        <div class="answer">
          <p>The Bank Verification Number (BVN) is an 11-digit biometric identifier introduced by the Central Bank of Nigeria for customers. It enhances security, reduces fraud, and streamlines financial services by providing a standardised means of verifying and authenticating individual's identities.

            BVN links multiple bank accounts, aids in compliance with regulatory policies, and is used beyond banking for identity verification in various services.
            
            BVN provides a unique identity for each beneficiary. </p>
